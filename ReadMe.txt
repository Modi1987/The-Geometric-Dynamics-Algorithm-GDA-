Description:
--------------------------------------
The accompanying MATLAB code computes the robot dynamics using GDA method.

Various quantities of robot dynamics can be calculated while at the same time achieving computational efficiency. GDA is used for deducing efficient algorithms to calculate the (1) joint space inertia matrix (JSIM), (2) joint space Coriolis matrix, (3) joint space centrifugal matrix, and the (4) time derivative of joint space inertia matrix in O(n2).
